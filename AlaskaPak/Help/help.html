    <p>
    This is the help document for version 3.0 of Alaska Pak.
    This version is built for ArcGIS 10, and will not run on previous versions of ArcGIS.
    It is only available as an Add-in (see ArcGIS help for using Add-Ins).
    </p>
    <p>
    This add-in is a work in progress, and will be updated on a regular basis.
    We are expecting Alaska Pak 3.0 to be complete in the Spring of 2011.
    </p>
    <p>
    Several of the commands are being proxied by the similar built-in command or toolbox.
    In some cases the Alaska Pak commands were built because this built-in functionality
    did not exist in previous versions, and the new built-in command is now the prefered
    method, and the olde Alaska Pak command will not be replicated.
    </p>
    <p>
    However, in some cases the Alaska Pak provided additional features, or simplied a complex tool
    in which case the Alaska Pak tool be be made available to replace the proxy.
