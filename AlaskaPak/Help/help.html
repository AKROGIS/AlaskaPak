        <hr />
        <p>
            This is the help document for version 3.0 of Alaska Pak.
            This version is built for ArcGIS 10, and will not run on previous versions of ArcGIS.
            It is only available as an Add-in (see ArcGIS help for using Add-Ins).
        </p>
        <p>
            This add-in is a work in progress, and will be updated on a regular basis.
            We are expecting Alaska Pak 3.0 to be complete in the Spring of 2011.
        </p>
        <p>
            Several of the commands are being proxied by the similar built-in command or toolbox.
            In some cases the Alaska Pak commands were built because this built-in functionality
            did not exist in previous versions, and the new built-in command is now the prefered
            method, and the olde Alaska Pak command will not be replicated.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, in some cases the Alaska Pak provided additional features, or simplied a complex tool
            in which case the Alaska Pak tool be be made available to replace the proxy.

        <h2>Known Issues</h2>
        <ol>
        <li>
            Some tools (i.e. Add XY Coordinates, Random Selection, Copy Raster Symbology) display a picklist of layers that the user can use in the tool. 
            This list updates automatically whenever the user makes changes to the map's table of contents even if the tool is open.
            However if there are multiple data frames in the map, only one data frame is active at a time, and while you can make changes to any data frame,
            the tools will only recognize changes to the active data frame.  If you make changes to a non-active dataframe, simply make it active, and the
            tool will recognize the changes and update the layers accordingly
        </li>
        <li>
            Most tools only require an ArcView license level, and no extensions.  The following exceptions are:
            <ul>
                <li>Add Attributes:Add Globally Unique Id (ArcEditor)</li>
                <li>Grids:Generate Grid Points (ArcInfo)</li>
                <li>Conversions:Polyline/Polygon To Point (ArcInfo)</li>
                <li>Conversions:Point To Polygon (ArcInfo)</li>
                <li>Randomize:Random Points (ArcInfo or ArcView with Spatial Analyst or ArcView with 3D Analyst)</li>
                <li>Randomize:Obscure Points (ArcInfo, only if using optional <b>No Go</b> or <b>Must Go</b> areas)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        </ol>
