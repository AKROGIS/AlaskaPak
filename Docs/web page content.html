		<h1>NPS AlaskaPak v3.0</h1> 
		<h5>Updated August 17, 2011</h5>
		<hr />
		<p style="color:red;font-weight:bold">
		You must have ArcGIS 10 to use v3.0.
		</p>
		<p>
		Version 3.0 of AlaskaPak is a complete re-write of the old toolkit
		(which was written in the now unsupported VB6 programming language).
		The toolkit is now a collection of geoprocessing (GP) tools in an ArcGIS Toolbox
		and a handful of ArcGIS 10 AddIn commands.  The commands and GP tools are
		all organized on a single toolbar for easy access.  Each tool is registered with the
		ArcGIS customization system, so you can build your own toolbar with just the tools you want.
		The GP tools can be used in your own models and scripts just like any other GP tool.
		</p>

		<h4>Installing version 3.0</h4>
		<p>
		NPS AlaskaPak v3.0 is no longer distributed as a 'windows application' and it does not
		require any administrative permissions to install or use.  It can also be configured
		to run from a network location that can be centrally managed for a team of users.
		Unfortunately, the standard windows installation process does not easily support these
		design decisions, so the installation is a little more "hands-on" than in previous
		versions. Compelete instructions are provided in link below.
		</p>
		
		<h4>Getting Help</h4>
		<p>
		Help documentation is admittedly thin in this release.
		Hopefully that will be fixed soon.
		All of the GP tools support the Toolbox style help
		and the addins are fairly intuitive.
		If you have any questions, send them to
